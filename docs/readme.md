### Code explanation of even_odd function
The code is very simple. It has counters for total sum of even number odd number and the count of them. 
When user exits terminates the progam it just divides sum by count and that how it calculates the avarge. 
#### Dificulties  
Intresting part part that I should check if the total numbers of even numbers and odd numbers is not equal to 0. Unless it gets division by zero exception, which was hard to find.
