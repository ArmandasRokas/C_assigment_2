## Even_odd.c
### Explanation of even_odd function
The code is very simple. Firstly, it has counters for the total sum of even numbers and odd number. Secondly there are counters for each of them, which holds the number of times entered odd or even number. 
When user exits decides to terminate the progam it just divides the sum by times entered and prints results. 
### Difficulties  
There was a bug which was caused by division by 0, when no even or odd numbers was added. The bug is fixed by added extra controls statments at the end of program, that checks if total number of even or add numbers is not equal to 0.
