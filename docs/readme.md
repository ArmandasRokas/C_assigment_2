## Even_odd.c
### Explanation of even_odd function
The code is very simple. Firstly, it has counters for the total sum of even numbers and odd numbers. Secondly there are also two more counters, which holds the values of how many times odd number and even number was entered.
When user exits decides to terminate the progam it divides the sum of even/odd numbers by the number of times entered even/odd numbers and prints results. 
### Difficulties  
There was a bug which was caused by division by 0, when no even or odd numbers was added. The bug is fixed by adding extra selection statments at the end of program, which checks if  the number of times entered even/add numbers is not equal to 0.
